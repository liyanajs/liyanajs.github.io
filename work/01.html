                <p>The "Changokushi Heroes" dashboard was born out of a necessity for clarity. The game team needed a way to visualize complex economy flow and player engagement metrics in real-time, moving away from static spreadsheets to a living, breathing interface.</p>

                <h3>The "Hybrid API" Architecture</h3>
                <p>The most challenging yet rewarding part of this build was orchestrating the data flow. The core game logic resides in a high-performance <strong>.NET environment</strong>, which handles the heavy lifting of game states and player stats.</p>
                <br>
                <p>However, the dashboard required agility. Instead of exposing the .NET endpoints directly, I utilized <strong>Next.js API routes</strong> as a middleware layer. This allowed me to aggregate data from multiple game services, sanitize the responses, and deliver a clean, type-safe payload to the frontend. It was a lesson in building a scalable "Backend for Frontend" (BFF) architecture.</p>

                <h3>The "Hybrid API" Architecture</h3>
                <p>The core game logic resides in a high-performance <strong>.NET environment</strong>. To bridge this with our web dashboard, we utilized <strong>Next.js API routes</strong> as a middleware layer.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Initially, I worked with endpoints established by senior engineers to build the UI. However, as the project scaled, I took ownership of the backend integration. I transitioned into designing my own API endpoints—defining the response structures, aggregating data from multiple services, and collaborating with the team to finalize the JSON contracts. It was a pivotal period where I moved from simply consuming APIs to engineering them.</p>

                <h3>Visualizing the Economy</h3>
                <p>Data is only useful if it tells a story. I leveraged TypeScript to ensure strict type safety from the database all the way to the UI components.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The dashboard features dynamic charts that update as the game economy shifts, flagging anomalies like currency inflation or server load spikes instantly. This required writing custom API endpoints in Next.js to cache and calculate trends that didn't exist in the original game server.</p>
